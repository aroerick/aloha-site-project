# Aloha Apparel

A simple home page for the Aloha Apparel website.

## The Goods

The bulk of this site is in the HTML structuring and harnessing that in the CSS, then sprinkling in a little bit of javascript for extra flavor. 

Semantic HTML is at the forefront here, using tags like section, nav etc. rather than just div>ing the crap out of everything.

CSS was implemented in a mobile first approach, with responsive elements changing at multiple break points for tablet and desktop.

The flickity carousel and smooth scrolling were based in javascript.

## The Learns

Be semantic af. Keeps things clean and easy to understand/interact with.

JAVASCRIPT. Just all of it. What is it.

Flexbox and grid are incredible. I don't miss floats. Flexbox in your grids in your flexbox instead.
